At about one-quarter the diameter of Earth (comparable to the width of Australia), it is the largest natural satellite in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet, the fifth largest satellite in the Solar System overall, and is larger than any dwarf planet .\nOrbiting Earth at an average distance of 384,400 km (238,900 mi), or about 30 times Earth\'s diameter, its gravitational influence slightly lengthens Earth\'s day and is the main driver of Earth\'s tides. The Moon is classified as a planetary-mass object and a differentiated rocky body, and lacks any significant atmosphere, hydrosphere, or magnetic field.\nIts surface gravity is about one-sixth of Earth\'s (0.1654 g); Jupiter\'s moon Io is the only satellite in the Solar System known to have a higher surface gravity and density.</string>
